# SAT Sudoku Solver

This is the implementation of the SAT sudoku solver based on the paper by Inês Lynce and Jöel
Ouaknine titled _Sudoku as a SAT Problem_.

Sudoku is modeled as the SAT problem. The idea is to formulate a sudoku puzzle as a SAT formula if
the puzzle has a solution. Then we use the SAT program to find the solution.

SAT is a program that solves the satisfiability problem: given a formula, it either returns an
assignment that makes it true, or says that no such assignment exists. It uses a restricted form of
propositional formula called CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form). CNF consists of a set of clauses, each
of which is a set of literals. A literal is a variable or its negation. Each clause is interpreted
as the disjunction of its literals, and the formula as a whole is interpreted as the conjunction of
the clauses.

This project uses [MiniSat](http://minisat.se/)'s Rust reimplementation
[RatSat](https://github.com/qnighy/ratsat).

For the in-depth explanation of how the sudoku solver works, see the [paper](paper.pdf).

## API

```console
$ ./solve A_PATH_TO_THE_PUZZLE
```

## Examples

There are 9 sample sudoku puzzles available under directory named `puzzles`. To solve the first
puzzle, simply run `./solve puzzles/sudoku1.puzzle`.
